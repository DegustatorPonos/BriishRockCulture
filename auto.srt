1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,430

2
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:09,560
Seven billion hungry ghosts

3
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:13,350
Just a parasite killing its host

4
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:17,750
The emperor wears no clothes, I see those brittle bones

5
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:21,590
But we're buried by modern misery

6
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:27,500

7
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:29,920
Modern misery

8
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:36,660

9
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:40,500
There's not enough water in the world

10
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,890
To wash the blood from our hands

11
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:47,260
We planted a seed, its roots will suffocate the soul

12
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:51,480
It grows without light and feeds from our bones

13
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:54,970
Hell must be empty, all the devils are here

14
00:00:54,970 --> 00:00:57,520
Singing us the Lord's Prayer

15
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:03,820
Finally, something that we all share

16
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:12,470
I won't go to the grave with the song still in me

17
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:16,760
What are we hiding in the rain?

18
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:20,640
This is a prison for lost souls

19
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,260
Another life circles the drain

20
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:29,110
We used to run with the wolves

21
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:33,260
Now we can't see the forest

22
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:37,180
Cause there's no light in the black hole

23
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:40,260
Don't try and tell me we are blessed

24
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:45,250
We used to run with the wolves

25
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:49,730
Are these our new messiahs?

26
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:52,940
Cause the saviour has a gun to my head

27
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:57,100
Don't be fooled by Maya, the kings are all thieves

28
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:60,680
And the serpents will bite as they please

29
00:01:60,680 --> 00:02:06,040
How has it come to this?

30
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:13,990
I won't go to the grave with the song still in me

31
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:22,830
And I won't live like a slave begging from my knees

32
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:27,180
What are we hiding in the rain?

33
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:31,010
This is a prison for lost souls

34
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:34,560
Another life circles the drain

35
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:39,550
We used to run with the wolves

36
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:43,460
Now we can't see the forest

37
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:47,620
Cause there's no light in the black hole

38
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:51,050
Don't try and tell me we are blessed

39
00:02:51,050 --> 00:03:03,330
We used to run with the wolves

40
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:07,420
Seven billion hungry ghosts

41
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:11,440
Just a parasite killing its host

42
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,700
The emperor wears no clothes, I see those brittle bones

43
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:25,500
But we're buried by modern misery

44
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:28,310
Modern misery

45
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:32,320
I won't live like a slave, I won't beg from my knees

46
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:40,330
I will not go to the grave with the song still in me

47
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:48,790
We used to run with the wolves

48
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:57,180
We used to run with the wolves

49
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:05,570
We used to run with the wolves

50
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:09,550
We used to run with the wolves
