1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,450
MODERN MISERY

2
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:09,370
Seven billion hungry ghosts

3
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:13,600
Just a parasite killing its host

4
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:18,000
The emperor wears no clothes, I see those brittle bones

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
But we're buried by modern misery

6
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:30.570
Modern misery

7
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
There's not enough water in the world

8
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
To wash the blood from our hands

9
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
We planted a seed, its roots will suffocate the soul

10
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
It grows without light and feeds from our bones

11
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hell must be empty, all the devils are here

12
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Singing us the Lord's Prayer

13
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Finally, something that we all share

14
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
I won't go to the grave with the song still in me

15
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
What are we hiding in the rain?

16
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
This is a prison for lost souls

17
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Another life circles the drain

18
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
We used to run with the wolves

19
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Now we can't see the forest

20
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
'Cause there's no light in the black hole

21
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Don't try and tell me we are blessed

22
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
We used to run with the wolves

23
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Are these our new messiahs?

24
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
'Cause the saviour has a gun to my head

25
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Don't be fooled by Maya, the kings are all thieves

26
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
And the serpents will bite as they please

27
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
How has it come to this?

28
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
I won't go to the grave with the song still in me

29
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
And I won't live like a slave begging from my knees

30
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
What are we hiding in the rain?

31
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
This is a prison for lost souls

32
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Another life circles the drain

33
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
We used to run with the wolves

34
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Now we can't see the forest

35
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
'Cause there's no light in the black hole

36
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Don't try and tell me we are blessed

37
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
We used to run with the wolves

38
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Seven billion hungry ghosts

39
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Just a parasite killing its host

40
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The emperor wears no clothes, I see those brittle bones

41
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
But we're buried by modern misery

42
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Modern misery

43
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
I won't live like a slave, I won't beg from my knees

44
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
I will not go to the grave with the song still in me

45
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
We used to run with the wolves

46
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
We used to run with the wolves

47
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
We used to run with the wolves

48
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
We used to run with the wolves
